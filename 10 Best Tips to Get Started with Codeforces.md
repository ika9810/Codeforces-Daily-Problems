## 10 Best Tips to Get Started with Codeforces

1. Start with the basics: If you are new to competitive programming, start with the basics. Codeforces provides a PROBLEMSET option where you can set the difficulty level to 800-1000 and start solving problems. This will help you get familiar with the platform and the types of questions you can expect.

2. Participate in contests: Codeforces hosts 2-3 contests every week, and participating in them can help you improve your skills. Don't worry if you are not able to solve all the problems initially, it takes time and practice to get better.

3. Focus on time management: Contests are time-bound, so it's important to focus on time management. Try to solve problems as quickly as possible and move on to the next one.

4. Review editorial solutions: If you get stuck on a problem, try to solve it on your own first. If you are still unable to solve it, review the editorial solutions. But don't just copy the solution, try to understand it and learn from it.

5. Up-solve after contests: After each contest, try to solve the remaining problems. This will help you learn new concepts and tricks.

6. Learn from other users: After solving practice problems, look at solutions of other users. You can learn different and easy approaches from them, which can help you in further problems.

7. Increase difficulty level: As you become confident in solving questions of a particular difficulty level, increase the difficulty level of the questions.

8. Use tags to practice specific topics: Codeforces allows you to add tags to problems, so you can practice problems related to specific topics.

9. Don't lose confidence: If you find a question difficult, don't lose confidence. Take adequate time to try to solve the problem and seek help if needed.

10. Be consistent: Consistency is key in competitive programming. Keep practicing regularly and you will see improvement over time.


To get started with Codeforces, beginners should start with the basics by solving problems with a difficulty level of 800-1000 in the PROBLEMSET section.
